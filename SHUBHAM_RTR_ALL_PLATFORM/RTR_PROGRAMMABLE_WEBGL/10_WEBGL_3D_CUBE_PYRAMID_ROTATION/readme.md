This code is a JavaScript program that sets up a WebGL scene to draw a pyramid and a cube. It initializes the WebGL context, compiles and links the shaders, creates the buffers for the pyramid and cube vertices, sets up the view and projection matrices, and renders the scene.

The code defines several variables to hold WebGL objects such as the canvas, the WebGL context, and the shader program. It also defines several variables to hold data such as the vertices for the pyramid and cube, the rotation angles, and the projection matrix.

The init() function initializes the WebGL context, compiles and links the shaders, and creates the buffers for the pyramid and cube vertices. The draw() function sets up the view and projection matrices and renders the scene.

The toggleFullScreen() function switches the canvas between full-screen and normal mode.

The keyDown() function handles key events for rotating the pyramid and cube. The mouseDown() function handles mouse events for rotating the pyramid and cube. The resize() function handles window resize events and updates the projection matrix accordingly.

Note that some parts of the code, such as the definitions of constants and WebGL macros, are missing, so it may not run as-is.
